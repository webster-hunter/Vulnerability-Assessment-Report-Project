# Vulnerability-Assessment-Report-Project


# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  In this assignment, the client is a financial services company in need of a secure encryption algorithm to protect sensitive data transfers.

# What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
  I believe that I did a good job in diagnosing the appropriate encryption algorithm for the given scenario. In this sorts of situations, risking a security breach means putting a large amount customers/clients in danger by exposing sensitive data such as names, addresses, or even more dangerous personal information like social security numbers. Ensuring that your code is secure serves as a shield for both users and the company from personal, financial, and reputational harm.

# What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
  I had never worked with anything close to the tools we employed throughout the course. It took a long while before I reached a solid comfort level with everything from vulnerability assessment to certificate generation.

# How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
  In general, it took me a while to wrap my head around how I should approach implementing security measures. Before this point, my code consisted of achieving a task in the most efficient matter I could devise. Because of this, I am just beginning to grasp the appropriate means of refining things like how I compromise between security and speed in the security measures I take. In the future, I intend on progressing these skills in order to better my security knowledge

# What resources or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Throughout my experience in this class, I relied heavily on textbook knowledge and digging through StackOverflow threads. I believe that I will continue to lean on these sorts of knowledgge bases in the future, but hope to deviate from paralleling their examples as I develop my own knowledge.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
  From the assignment that I have uploaded here, I would hope to show that I intend to be thorough in my work. While at this point I might be scratching the surface of the knowledge commonly held in this field, I fully intend to continue to refine how I approach developing software in a secure manner.
